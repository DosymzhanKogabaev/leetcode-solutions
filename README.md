**Language:** TypeScript  
**Focus Areas:** Data Structures, Algorithms, Problem Solving

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- TypeScript compiler

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DosymzhanKogabaev/leetcode-solutions.git
cd leetcode

# Install TypeScript globally (if not already installed)
npm install -g typescript

# Compile and run any solution
tsc [problem-number].ts && node [problem-number].js

# Example:
tsc 0002.ts && node 0002.js
```

### Running Individual Solutions
Each file contains the solution function along with test cases. Simply compile and run:

```bash
# For problem 2 (Add Two Numbers)
tsc 0002.ts && node 0002.js

# For problem 3 (Longest Substring)
tsc 0003.ts && node 0003.js
```

## üé® Code Style

- **Language:** TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Naming:** Descriptive variable and function names
- **Comments:** Clear explanations for complex logic
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test cases included in some files
